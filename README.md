Website built in ReactJS that is called Restaurent Gerich. This is a Single Page Application (SPA) that works with dummy data since there is no API.

Tech stack:

- ReactJS
- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
- JSX

To fire it up, clone the project and do NPM install. Then npm start and a server should start on port 3000 :-)
